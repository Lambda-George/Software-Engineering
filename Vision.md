### Students currently use multiple applications to view classes, however  these applications have issues. Timetabler is the primary application used for viewing class timetables and exams however only contains basic functionality. In addition not all exams/assessments are listed. The calendar on outlook supports the creation of custom events, however, the calendar itself is fairly hidden and may be easy to miss. Lastly, Blackboard is used to view announcements from module organisers. These announcements are also sent to the students' email however, students don't check their school email often and it is vital for students to see these announcements as they may state timetable changes which have not been updated in Timetabler and Outlook Calendar. Students and staff need a centralised platform with accurate and up-to-date information to monitor their schedules, create customised tasks with dependencies to define their progress, and view important announcements. Upon successful development and deployment of this application, there should be a noticable increase in student engagement and higher satisfaction ratings from both staff and students of the platform, when compared to Timetabler, Outlook and Blackboard.
