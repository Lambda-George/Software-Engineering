## 1) As a student I would like one platform to view timetables, exams and plan my week so I don't have to open and log in to multiple websites, saving me time.

## 2) As a module organiser I would like my announcements to be visible to as many students as possible, so vital information is not overlooked.

## 3) As a lecturer, I would like my students to be notified of any changes to the occurrences of my lectures to ensure maximum engagement with my teaching.
